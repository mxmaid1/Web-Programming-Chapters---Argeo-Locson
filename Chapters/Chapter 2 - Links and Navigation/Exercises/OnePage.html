        <h1>Plot</h1>
        <p>
            Persona 3 is set in 2009 in the fictional Japanese city of Iwatodai. The story follows a group of high school students who are members of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES). They investigate the "Dark Hour," a hidden time between one day and the next, during which most people are unconscious, and the world is infested with Shadows. The members of SEES can summon "Personas," manifestations of their inner selves, to combat these entities. The narrative delves into themes of life, death, and the human psyche.

            "Persona 3 is the best video game i have ever played. I instantly fell in love with the characters and grew very attached to all of them. The story sucks you right in and is very interesting from start to finish. The game has amazing themes that stick with you forever. The gameplay can be clunky and pretty hard but it is never too punishing. The soundtrack is my favorite video game soundtrack ever. Every song is catchy and amazing. There are different versions of the game that are quite different. Vanilla persona 3 is obsolete compared to persona 3 FES which adds a lot of new improvements and content. Persona 3 portable removes anime cutscenes, the new epilogue from FES and 3d environments outside of the main dungeon Tartarus. This version does add a LOT of quality of life improvements and new content including a new female protagonist to play as which changes so much its like a new game. If you want a better visual experience play FES but if you want better gameplay play portable. My preferred version is portable for those reasons but persona 3 is amazing regardless of the version. 10000000000/10 game please play if you are interested. There isnt a better rpg out there."

            "If I could i would have made this a 3.5 star review but whatever the story in my opinion is meh and the only sad part is the third to last boss and the final boss other than that not any worth while mentions of story here. The social links compared to 4 and 5 are kinda bland and the only ones I kind of cared about was the sun, temperance, and chariot social links. The main characters did not really click with me i did not really hate any of them its just they didn't really have much going for them. My favorite story wise event would be new years event I wish they had more of those events. My favorite aspect of the game is the collecting of demons and dungeon crawling I love how you choose your own personas their fusions and whatnot. Even though the AI can be annoying sometimes most of that is up to how you set them up not the AI. I actually really liked tartarus for some crazy reason ig I really liked the atmosphere or smthn. The bosses are tough so grind for that and story bosses are pretty easy but pay attention to their gimmicks. Anyway this is my review of Persona 3 signing out"
